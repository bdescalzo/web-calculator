# web-calculator

This project is a simple calculator built in HTML, CSS and JS.

## Usage

Usage is simple: user must input numbers and/or operators using the on-screen buttons, as if they were using a physical calculator.

## Building

As this project runs on the browser, this step can be completely omitted: downloading the project folder and opening the index.html file on a web browser should be enough to try it.
